> **A Personal Time Machine for the Web.**

##  About the Project

**Time Traveler's Web** is a single-page interactive project that serves as a digital time capsule, allowing users to experience the distinct design eras of the internet from the 1980s to today. The project is built to be a fun, nostalgic, and educational journey through the changing aesthetics and culture of web design. By clicking a year on the timeline, the entire website's theme changes‚Äîincluding colors, fonts, and even sound effects‚Äîto reflect that era.

##  Features

* **Interactive Timeline:** A simple navigation bar to jump between different eras of web design.

* **Dynamic Theming:** The entire visual style of the website changes with a single click, powered by **CSS custom properties**.

* **Era-Specific Soundscapes:** Each era has a unique sound effect, from a low hum for the terminal to a playful beep for the GeoCities era, created using the **Web Audio API**.

* **Retro Aesthetics:** Each theme is a tribute to its time, including the text-based terminal of 1985, the animated chaos of 1995, and the clean flat design of 2015.

* **Hidden Easter Egg:** Enter the classic **Konami code** (`‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üê ‚Üí B A`) to trigger a rapid-fire time travel animation..

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

* **Vanilla HTML:** For the page structure.

* **Vanilla CSS:** For all styling, using custom properties for dynamic themes.

* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all interactive logic and sound effects.

##  What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to reinforce my understanding of core web technologies. I gained a deeper appreciation for the history of web design and the technical limitations that shaped it. On a technical level, I learned a crucial lesson about **JavaScript variable scope** while debugging the Konami code, and I enjoyed exploring the capabilities of the Web Audio API.

##  What's Next for Time Traveler's Web

I have several ideas to expand on this project:

* **Make it Interactive:** Add a feature that allows users to build and save their own GeoCities-style pages.

* **Expand the Timeline:** Add more design eras, such as the social media-driven late 2000s and early mobile internet.

* **Increase Immersion:** Integrate more era-specific features, such as a "Top 8 Friends" list for the 2005 MySpace theme.
